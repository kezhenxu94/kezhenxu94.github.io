title: Adding free HTTPS/SSL certificate to Kubernetes service with Istio, Let's Encrypt and cert-manager
summary: |
  In this tutorial, I will guide you step by step on how to add a free HTTPS/SSL certificate to your Kubernetes service with Istio gateway using Let's Encrypt and cert-manager, so that your application can be accessed securely over HTTPS with an auto-renewing certificate

Before we start the tutorial, I will assuming that you have a running Kubernetes cluster, with the ability to allocate a public IP address to your service, because we will need it to be accessible from the internet.

# Install Istio

Let's start by installing Istio in your Kubernetes cluster. You can follow the guide on [the official Istio website](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/) but here is the command to install Istio with the default profile:

```bash
istioctl install -y
```

After several minutes, you should be able to see the Istio ingress gateway service running in the `istio-system` namespace with a public IP address:

```bash
kubectl -n istio-system get svc istio-ingressgateway
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                                      AGE
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.3.252.105   34.150.16.112   15021:30694/TCP,80:31846/TCP,443:30717/TCP   2m47s
```

# Configure DNS record for your domain

In the last step, we have obtained the public IP address of the Istio ingress gateway service, now we need to configure a DNS record for your domain to point to this IP address.

In this tutorial, I'm going to use the domain `letsencrypt.kezhenxu94.me` as an example, you should replace it with your own domain name.

You can do this by adding an `A` record to your domain's DNS settings, with the value of the public IP address, I'm using Cloudflare as my DNS provider, so here is how I do it:

# Install cert-manager

> cert-manager is a powerful and extensible X.509 certificate controller for Kubernetes and OpenShift workloads. It will obtain certificates from a variety of Issuers, both popular public Issuers as well as private Issuers, and ensure the certificates are valid and up-to-date, and will attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.

We will obtain and re-new certificates by leveraging cert-manager, let's install it according to [the official guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/):

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update
helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.16.2 \
  --set crds.enabled=true
```

# Install example service

## Build and push example Docker image (optional)

> [!TIP]
> If you don't want to build the Docker image by yourself, you can use my pre-built image `kezhenxu94/nginx-ssl-example:1.0.0` directly.

We are going to use a very simple example service - an Nginx server with the default index page, here is the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile:Dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.25.3

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Let's build the Docker image and push it to a container registry:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -t kezhenxu94/nginx-ssl-example:1.0.0 .
```

## Deploy example service

In order to make it easier for you to modify the domain name and the image name, I'm going to use a Helm chart to deploy the example service, you can download the Helm Chart from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/kezhenxu94/kezhenxu94.me/tree/main/public/static/code/letsencrypt-kubernetes/kubernetes/).

And here is the Helm chart values file:

```yaml:values.yaml
image:
  repository: kezhenxu94/nginx-ssl-example:1.0.0
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: latest

replicas: 1
resources:
  cpu: 1
  memory: 500Mi

gateway:
  issuer:
    email: info@kezhenxu94.me
  hosts: &hosts
    - letsencrypt.kezhenxu94.me
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  http:
    hosts: *hosts
  https:
    hosts: *hosts
```

in the `gateway.hosts` field, you should replace `letsencrypt.kezhenxu94.me` with your own domain name, and that's all you need to do.

Now let's install the example service with the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install letsencrypt-sample . --values ./values.yaml
```

After a few seconds, you should be able to see a Pod named `cm-acme-http-resolver-xxxx`, this is used for Let's Encrypt to verify your domain ownership:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A | grep acme
istio-system      cm-acme-http-solver-kckvx                             1/1     Running            0          11s
```

And the Pod will be deleted after your domain ownership is verified and the certificate is issued, you can check the certificate status by running:

```bash
kubectl get certificate -A

NAMESPACE      NAME                         READY   SECRET                       AGE
istio-system   default-letsencrypt-sample   True    default-letsencrypt-sample   4m30s
```

you can see the `READY` field is `True`, which means the certificate is ready to use.

# Test the service

Now you can navigate to your domain [https://letsencrypt.kezhenxu94.me](https://letsencrypt.kezhenxu94.me) in the browser, you should see the default Nginx index page, and the connection is secure with a valid certificate:

[![Nginx index page](/static/images/lets-encrypt-nginx.png)](/static/images/lets-encrypt-nginx.png)

If you click on the lock icon in the address bar, you can see the certificate information:

[![Certificate information](/static/images/lets-encrypt-certificate.png)](/static/images/lets-encrypt-certificate.png)

It's a valid Let's Encrypt certificate, and it will be auto-renewed by cert-manager before it expires, so you don't need to worry about it.
